Gradient

Gradient is a python package that computes clusters of unique substrings or "variant types" for user selected sequence features in a set of aligned sequences. Sequences can be nucleotide (DNA or RNA), or amino acid. Gradient takes as input a reference sequence, a list of one or more sequence positions and a multiple sequence alignments of related sequences. It produces a list of the different variant types as well as a list of which variant type each input sequence belongs to.

This package is a generalization of the sequence feature variant type (SFVT) work undertaken in the laboratory of Dr. Richard Scheuermann while at UT Southwestern. Please see the references below.
