FeaVar or **Fea**ture **Var**iant

FeaVar is a python package that reads in multiple sequence alignments, a reference sequence, and given a feature location, will group individual sequences into one of many clusters or variant types. This package is a generalization of the sequence feature variant type work undertaken in hte lab of Richard Scheuermann while at UT Southwestern.

Thanks to Joe Wan for the name suggestion!
